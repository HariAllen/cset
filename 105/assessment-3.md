How do you feel about the pace of the program so far? Is it too slow? Too fast? Or just right?

It feels a bit too fast for me, but its not something I can't adjust to. It feels like a lot at once, and I am good at remebering things in the short term. Its when I have to remember it for the long term
that things get rough. But I believe that I am handling it well. The asynchronous classes help me work through the things that we learned the best, so I think that helps.
I feel like it will feel faster because I only got up to functions in my other class, before covid hit, so I can only hope I will stick with the class's pace.

Why do you think functions are a useful tool to organize large programs?

You never have to copy and paste big things of code ever again. A function is a reliable loop that you can always call for without having to write it over again and again.
It also helps to organize your code much better, because you can name the function, and that can tell you so much more of what it is doing than a loop with the information within it.

In class, we've been using the analogy of a zoo to explain scope. Describe the different types of scope using this analogy and provide examples using real JavaScript code.

If I had to compare Javascript code to a zoo, I would call the global scope the entire zoo that holds the map to the parts of the zoo, and local scope being the exhibits that are all around
the zoo, each with their own animals and attractions. To compare that in Javascript terms, global scope is the place where variables, loops, functions, and methods can be created and used everywhere
in the program. Local scopes are within the global scope, but whatever is created in this scope can only be accessed within this scope, like a "let" variable made in a loop. BAck to the
zoo example, you can find all types of animals in a zoo, but you wouldn't see a bear in the snake exhibit.
