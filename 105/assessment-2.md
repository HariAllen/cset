After two weeks, what do you think is going to be your biggest challenge with this program? And how will you try to overcome it?

Honestly, my biggest challenge is to have the motivation to start on my own project. I know I want to do this as a profession, but I get nervous and easily-proned to
doubting myself. It doesn't help that I'm already pretty nervous about the COVID-19 pandemic, and that I have a tendency to not ask for help until I really need it.
I feel like if I could get rid of those anxieties and bad habits, I would be on a fast track on becoming a confident programmer. 

As a side note, I try not to jump ahead often or at all because I did that when I was in highschool, but I remember absolutly nothing from those classes, general or elective 
classes, so right now I'm trying to soak up as much knowledge as possible so I don't overwork myself.

Describe the differences between the three styles of loops: for, while, and do...while.

For loops are the most efficent of the three loops because it allows programmers to control the entire loop, without any outside interference in the algorithm. While and
do-while loops are functionaly the same loop; While loops will only do things if the condition is true, while a Do-While loop will do things while the condition is true. The main 
difference between the two is that the Do-While loop will always do the loop once without question, but a While loop won't do a cycle without the condition being true.

We've learned to split problem solving into two parts: writing the solution in English or pseudocode, then translating the solution into JavaScript. Why is this important 
and how will it help you in future classes?

It is important because it can help visualize the problem and solution without all of the code-jargon that you see. As an example, you wouldn't give a high level mathematic
question to someone who just started learning the basics of math, would you? Comparing that situation to writing pseudocode in programming, the high level math problem, or the 
programwe are working on, can be explained thtrough the lessons and chapters of math, or the pseudocode, to the person with no history in math, or a budding programmer. All in
all, pseudocode is the visualization of a step-by-step guide on how you, or someone else, solved a program.
