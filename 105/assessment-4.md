After completing the first course, how would you rate yourself? Is there anything you want to do differently to start the next course?

I feel like I have gotten good with Javascript, but I'm not exactly sure yet, either. It feels like the last two weeks had really challenged
my way of thinking, since I like doing code step by step, but i always see shortcuts used in answers and discussions.I do feel much more confidence in my
fundamentals in coding, which I would definitely call an improvement from before. I feel like one thing that i would definitely change is the amount of notes I take,
since sometimes I have things written down that I don't really need, so from now on I just try to get the most important parts memorized.

The Weresquirrel program showed many uses for JavaScript Objects and Arrays. Using variables and values 
from this example, explain the difference between the two data structures.

One big difference is the fact that all arrays are objects, but not all objects are arrays. Now, using variables and values to tell the difference, in an array
everything that is in the array has an index. It starts at 0, and you can always call anything in the array, variable or vaule, by its index.
You can't, however, pcik and choose what can get taken out, since the pop() method only takes things at the end of the array out, and nothing else. You can replace indexed 
values with different values, though. An object, in turn, can only take variables and values inside of their keys, which works differently than an index.
You can add and takeaway any key that you want, while also replacing what's inside of that key. The one thing you can't do is change a key's name, or make a prewritten variable 
a key name. It will only take the variables name, not what's in it. 

Now explain why the author chose to use one structure over the other for each example you chose. 
Follow the same reasoning and explain how you could have used objects and arrays in your adventure game from last week.

The example chose is the huge JOURNAL array that the author made. In this array There are many, many objects that have different values within them. He chose an array for the
JOURNAL because it would make it easier to call a specific day out compared to it being an object. The objects in the array are objects because nothing really has to be in a 
certain order, unlike arrays. Objects could've made a choose-your-own-adventure easier to code by having an object named stats and having keys that represented whatever you needed
in there, like health and magic.
