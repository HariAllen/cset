Now that you've spent a few weeks working on longer projects, how do you think you'll adapt to working in the professional world?

I feel like I would do well in a professional environment, because I have already had a taste of it during the summer. I was working with my high school's Tech Department and was helping them out with setting up the new iPads, laptops and chrome books for the school year. Even though we had issues with some deliveries not show up on time, we were still able to send of the devices with the appropriate account for every student and teacher without a hitch. Doing the projects in class gives me more tools that I could use in the professional world later in life, so it's been a good confidence booster.

Imagine you are building your Choose-Your-Own-Adventure project in JavaScript for the browser. The user has clicked a button to select which room to enter, walk through how you would manipulate the page to show the next room's description. Explain the DOM methods you would use and why.

If I were to use a DOM method, I think I would do something like "Every time the user leaves a room, refresh the page and start with the beginning of the new room's event." As in for each room change, the page clears, and there is a new descriptive paragraph at the top of the page so it really feels like they entered a new room. I would use recursion and have a separate function that clears the words off of the page.

Why are different data structures useful? Use the Document Object Model as an example. Would it work as any structure other than a tree?

Different data structures are useful because they can be used to take in and give out data in different ways. That gives programmers many options to work with that data instead of just one two. A good example of that is the DOM. If that was made to work like a regular object or an array, it would become so much more of a hassle to work with because of the extra steps it would take to get to the data that you want. It's the same with how the type of data you have could be better represented by an array of an object. If you have more choices to choose from, coding can become a lot easier to work with.
