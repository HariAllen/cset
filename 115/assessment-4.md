This is your last assessment of the semester. Overall, how comfortable would you feel answering questions like these in job interviews? Have they helped more than regular tests or quizzes?

I believe that I would be ok if I was asked questions like these in a job interview. I might fumble my words at first because of nervousness, but I think I would be able to pull through and get a favorable response from the employers. I also believe that these assessments were much more helpful than a quiz or test because unlike a test, It really tests my memory and understanding of a subject instead of making educated guesses for a quiz. It also helps to refresh anything that I might have forgotten about or was slowly slipping from my mind, which usually happens when I'm taking a test or quiz.

In the readings this week, you learned a sampling of client-side tooling. Choose one tool that you think will be the most beneficial for you. Explain what it does and why that's important.

I would say that the most useful client-tool for me would have to be the Safety Net. If I were to categorize my coding style, I would call it 'haphazardly fast' I can make my thoughts into code pretty quickly, but I rarely, if ever, check for any mistakes while I write my code. An easy example would be this very project! I had one win condition never appear, and I had only one O before never updating again. I would find out from my partner that there was a typo in the win-condition and a badly updated copy-paste chain. A safety net tool would be a much needed help for looking over faults.

Compare the different stages of the Waterfall and Agile methodologies using the Tic-Tac-Toe game as an example.

If we use the Waterfall method, Tic-Tac-Toe would go like 1) the main idea and requirements of the project, 2) the elements and layouts are created for the project, 3) The actual code worked on, 4) Test it for any bugs 5) have others play it 6) Release it to the public. The Agile method for Tic-Tac-Toe would go like we do all of the Waterfall steps is much smaller increments, and had Zach see over it and change the requirements when he wanted to.
