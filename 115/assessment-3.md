What do you think will be the most difficult aspect of developing a project in a larger team?

I think the most difficult thing is to just make sure that things are done on time. Even if there isn't a set due date for a project,(I doubt that this would ever be the case) making sure that you do your part when you need to seems to be the most important factor. And if something turns out to be wrong, you can fix it faster with your team because it would be noticed quicker, compared to turning it in late and only realizing later that it is wrong. My main point is that even if something is wrong, the sooner you can spot it the better. Doing something too late can and will mess everything up.

Briefly describe a branch and a remote. Compare the defaults to examples that you created.

A branch is a separate path of a project that isn't apart of the original branch/main branch. It could be a specialized branch that might only work with feature testing or quick code fixes. It is used for doing the underground work that is publicly shown with the main branch. A remote is an outside repository that the original project was from. Git allows you to copy it, and make changes to it without having to be on the original's place to change it. For example, since we only used the main branch, all of our projects have been on the main branch, which is copied from a remote repository(Github).

For the collaborative project this week, which git workflow(s) did you employ? Why?

I think it would've been the feature branch, since this type of work flow deals with adding/subtracting features and nothing else. Because I don't want to add any unnecessary features to someone else's work, I looked for something that might need a little fixing up, or something that could save space for better readability. I like this one because it is much easier to understand and follow with, after Centralized and Forking, since Gitflow is a bit too much for me to fully understand yet.
