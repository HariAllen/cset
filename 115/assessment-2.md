In the next few weeks, we'll be learning how professional developers work on larger projects. What are you most looking forward to in this section?

For the most part, even though I worry that I could mess something up, I am looking forward to how git interacts with a group of people. I really like using git, more than I thought I would, and since things like git are used in a professional setting, solo and collaboratively, I felt like it would be a good idea to try to get a hang of it now. I'm sure that I will be confused on some jargon here and there, but I look forward to it, none the less.

Briefly explain event propogation and bubbling using an example of two nested HTML elements.
You learned to use addEventListener on a DOM node to listen for a type of event and create a function to handle that event. When the event happens, that function is called with an Event Object that gives you more information about the event.

I am a bit puzzled on the idea of propogation, but what I under stand is that child elements inside of parent elements can be affected by the event handlers. They can be affected by a bubbling effect, or an interaction with a child element interacts with the parent as well, sort of like an inside->outside reaction. Something like focus and blur will affect the bubbling motion and can stop it from happening.

Choose two different event types and explain two properties of each that are unique to that event. Use your MDN reference for help.

I think two event types that are easy to show the difference between are the key button events and the error events. A key button event is when the javascript reacts to a button press on the keyboard. Some examples would be scrolling a webpage using the up an d down arrow keys, typing into a text editor, and shortcuts for copying, pasting and a command for taking screen shots. Error events are things that happen that the javascript doesn't have control of, or are things that are done incorrectly. An example of that would be entering the wrong website address for a website, or a notice of a server being down for maintenance. Key button events needs keys to be pressed, and Error events need something to go wrong or unanswered to come up.
