Pick your favorite CSS property so far. Explain what it's used for and all the potential values or units it can take. Why do you like it?

My favorite CSS property so far is the color property not only because of how easy it is to use and apply it, but also because of the reason you changed the colors of your text.
If I can find a color that is easier for me to read, reading over the website won't be too much strain over my eyes like it usually is. Another thing it helps out with is how,
for me anyway, it stands as a standard on how to put a property on a tag, which is useful in its own right.

Imagine you are making a website for a restaurant and you need to style the menu options to show that some are spicy or vegetarian or gluten-free. If all the menu options are using the same HTML elements, what CSS selector(s) could you use and why? Show an example.

I would use different styles of the list marks. I would have a key at the top that says one symbol is spicy, another is vegetarian and another is gluten free. Then I would 
list out all of the meals and have the appropriete symbol to tell the reader that that variation is available. For example, you could have a burger, or a vegetarian burger, and a
side meal that is spicy or regular. The buns of the burgers will be gluten free if they so choose. the burger would have 2 symbols and the side would have one symbol.

Style rules sometimes conflict with each other, especially in large projects. Explain the difference between cascade, inheritance, and specificity and how you can use these concepts to organize your CSS.

From what I can understand, cascade is the top-down order of things that will be changed with a style, inheritance is the parent/child type where the top tag's changes effect every
tag within it, and specificity is targeting only one element/tag to change and nothing else. Depending on the style changes that you want to use on your website, you can plan for
each style change that you will create, where it be in a order, carried within an entire block or specific instances in a block. Knowing when to use these style rules can make CSS
easier to work with in both the short and long run.
